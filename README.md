# WebBrancher
WebBrancher automates web recon by chaining directory, DNS, and vhost enumeration with Ffuf and SecLists. It recursively explores found endpoints, mapping the target as a branching tree. Results are easy to visualise, making it simple to uncover and prioritise a web appâ€™s hidden attack surface.
